## üí° About the project

> _This project is pretty straight forward. That's is my own C library. Inspired by the libft project of the 42 school, this library gathers all the most useful functions that I recoded entirely._

	I will regularly update this repo in order to add all the additional functions
	I will code during my cursus at the 42 school.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Requirements

The function is written in C language and thus needs the **`gcc` compiler** and some standard **C libraries** to run.

### Instructions

**1. Compiling the library**

To compile, run :

```shell
$ make
```

**2. Using it in your code**

To use the library functions in your code, simply include its header:

```C
#include "mylib.h"
```
